/**
 * The root event class for all control events. All events from an x10 engine
 * (transmitter or receiver) are synchronized with the AWT event queue. This
 * allows an application to mix control and AWT events without being concerned
 * with multi-threading problesm.
 * <P>
 * <STRONG>Note to Gateway Developers</STRONG>
 * <P>
 * The AWT event queue is obtained through the AWT Toolkit:
 * <BLOCKQUOTE>
 * <PRE>
 * import java.awt.*;
 * ...
 * EventQueue q = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getSystemEventQueue();
 * </PRE>
 * </BLOCKQUOTE>
 * A gateway should create a sub-class of AWTEvent that can be placed on the
 * AWT event queue. The gateway also needs to create a non-visual AWT
 * <CODE>Component</CODE> to receive the gateway's <CODE>AWTEvent</CODE>. When
 * the AWT event is notified to the gateway's component, the gateway should issue
 * the appropriate control event. The control event can be issued either from
 * the AWT event thread or from a sparate thread created by the gateway.
 * (Note that <CODE>ControlEvent</CODE> is not a sub-class of
 * <CODE>AWTEvent</CODE> so control events can not be placed directly on the
 * AWT event queue.)
