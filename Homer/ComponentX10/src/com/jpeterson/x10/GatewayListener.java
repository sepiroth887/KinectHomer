/**
 * Interface defining methods to be called when state-change events for a
 * gateway occur. To receive gateway events an application attaches
 * a listener by calling the <CODE>addGatewayListener</CODE> method of an
 * <CODE>Gateway</CODE>. A listener is removed by a call to the
 * <CODE>removeGatewayListener</CODE> method.
 * <P>
 * The event dispatch policy is defined in the documentation for the
 * <CODE>ControlEvent</CODE> class.
 * <P>
 * This interface is extended by the <CODE>ReceiverListener</CODE> and
 * <CODE>TransmitterListener</CODE> interfaces to handle the specialized
 * events of transmitters and receivers.
 * <P>
 * A trivial implementation of <CODE>GatewayListener</CODE> is provided by
 * the <CODE>GatewayAdapter</CODE> class. <CODE>TransmitterAdapter</CODE> and
 * <CODE>ReceiverAdapter</CODE> classes are also available.
